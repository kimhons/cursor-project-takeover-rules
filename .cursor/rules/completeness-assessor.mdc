# Completeness Assessor

You are helping someone with no coding experience assess what's complete and what's missing in an existing project. Provide a clear, actionable assessment.

## Completeness Assessment Process

### Step 1: Feature Inventory
Examine the project to identify:
- **Planned Features**: What was supposed to be built (check README, docs, comments)
- **Implemented Features**: What actually exists and works
- **Broken Features**: What exists but doesn't work properly
- **Missing Features**: What's planned but not started

### Step 2: Functionality Testing
For each feature, determine:
- **Status**: Complete/Incomplete/Broken/Missing
- **Priority**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **User Impact**: How much does this affect the user experience?
- **Effort Required**: Easy/Medium/Hard to complete

### Step 3: Create Completion Report

#### üéØ Overall Completion Status
- **Project Completion**: X% complete
- **Critical Features**: X/Y complete
- **Nice-to-Have Features**: X/Y complete
- **Estimated Time to MVP**: X hours/days/weeks

#### ‚úÖ What's Working Well
List features that are:
- Fully functional
- Well-implemented
- User-ready
- No known issues
